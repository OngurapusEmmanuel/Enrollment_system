3) Has anyone ever told you that you have: 
 Mental Retardation or an Intellectual Disability?
 Autism?
 Cerebral Palsy?

Brief Description of Developmental Disabilities
The conditions described below must have been present prior to the age of 18 years, likely to continue indefinitely, 
and be substantially impairing to the individual. Substantial impairments related solely to psychiatric disorders, 
learning disabilities, or other physical impairments are not considered to be a developmental disability.  
 Mental Retardation / Intellectual Disability:    
o Intelligence that is significantly below average, accompanied by impaired 
adaptive skills. 
o Most people require special help to cope with various life activities due to lack of 
understanding (Ex: completing paperwork, applications, and contracts, 
maintaining bills and finances, completing domestic activities, health & safety, 
etc.)  
o Often have history of receiving special education services in school for 
Intellectual Disability/Mental Retardation. 
 Placement in a Special Day Class is common, as well as receiving a 
Certificate of Completion rather than a High School Diploma.   
 Autistic Disorder:   
o History of markedly impaired social skills (Ex: poor eye contact, limited use of 
gestures, trouble starting and maintaining friendships, lack of reciprocity).  
o Poorly developed communication skills (Ex: history of early speech and language 
delay, difficulty starting and maintaining conversations, repetitive speech).  
o Presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors (Ex: preoccupation with certain 
interests, rigid routines and rituals, repetitive motor mannerisms).  
 Epilepsy:  
o Epilepsy is a neurological condition in which a person has a tendency to have 
recurring seizures.  
o To be considered a developmental disability, seizures must be significant and 
uncontrollable, even when appropriately medicated.  
 Cerebral Palsy:   
o Cerebral Palsy is a neurological disorder that affects motor ability.  
o To be a developmental disability, CP must significantly impact motor ability (Ex: 
impairs walking, talking, swallowing, and self‐care abilities).   
 ACRC also serves individuals with a condition closely related to Mental 
Retardation/Intellectual Disability, or requiring treatment similar to that required by 
those with MR/ID.
